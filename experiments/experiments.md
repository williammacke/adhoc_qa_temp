# Experiments
--------------------------------
## Experiment 1 -> Comparison of query timesteps
* Methodically evaluates every possible outcome in our running example and queries at different timesteps
* Worker Pos: (5,0)
* Fetcher Pos: (4,0)
* Tools Pos: (2,3)
* Station Pos: (7,2), (7,8) and (3,8)
---------------------------------------------------------
## Experiment 2 -> Comparison of query content
* Methodically evalutes every possible outcome in our running example and queries about different stations
* Worker Pos: (5,0)
* Fetcher Pos: (4,0)
* Tools Pos: (2,3)
* Station Pos: (7,2), (7,8) and (3,8)
---------------------------------------------------
## Experiment 3 -> Comparison of Query Strategies
* Compares querying strategies by running them in various randomly generated domains
* 50x50 Grid
* 400 stations
* Positions generated randomly
