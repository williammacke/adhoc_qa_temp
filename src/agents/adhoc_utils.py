class inference_engine():
    """
    This class helps us do inference on the agent. Given an observation/series of observations we should be able to derive a posterior probability on the type. However, in the current setting, since we only identify the next immediate station as a part of the type and not the entire sequence, we derive posterior probabilities for just that.

    So, basically, we have an obs. This contains the leader agent's position as well as the action it took. From this, we want to be able to infer which station the leader would be going to next.

    We want to do this by feeding the observation to a bunch of dummy agents with different station targets and see which station target explains the action the most. This way we can derive the posterior probabilities.

    We can obtain the set of dummy agents with different station targets by copying the original agent, and setting it's type accordingly.

    We delete and create a new inference engine everytime we finish working on a station
