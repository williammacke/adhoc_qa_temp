Leader:

Modifications from original:

Init:

1) Generate a random order of stations and tools.

At each step:

1) If a question is asked, pause and answer it.

2) Else:

If neighboring a station:

    If station task not completed:

        If next agent is here:

            Mark the task finished

        else

            Wait until next agent arrives.

 Else

        Navigate to the next station.

3) Repeat until all stations are marked done.
